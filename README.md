# Node.js Server Setup 🚀

This repository contains the initial setup for a Node.js based server. It provides a basic folder structure and essential modules to kickstart your application development.

## Overview 🗺️

The aim of this project is to provide a clean and organized starting point for building a Node.js application. This setup includes commonly used modules and a folder structure that can be easily expanded as your application grows.
